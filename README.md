# 🐢 Fun with F# and turtle geometry

The content of the workshop is based on content from the first two chapters of [Turtle Geometry: The Computer as a Medium for Exploring Mathematics](https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/4663/Turtle-GeometryThe-Computer-as-a-Medium-for) by Harold Abelson and Andrea diSessa.

Getting ready for [Booster 2026](https://www.boosterconf.no/2026/program/wednesday/9_short_talks_and_workshops/dreggen_4/fun-with-f-and-turtle-geometry/)

## 🚀 Getting started

Make sure you have .NET 10 SDK installed by running `dotnet --version` in the terminal. The .NET 10 SDK can be downloaded from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download. 

1. Clone the repository
1. Run `dotnet restore` from the project root the first time
1. Run `dotnet watch run`. This will run the app and automatically rebuild the app when you make changes in the code
1. Navigate to <http://localhost:5000> in your browser
1. If you see a square you are good to go! 

### Alternative ways of running the code

There is setup for devcontainer, which can be used to work with the code on GitHub, using GitHub Codespaces, or locally from an IDE like VS Code.
