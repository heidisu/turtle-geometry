# 🐢 Fun with F# and turtle geometry

**🚧 Under construction 🚧**

Getting ready for [Booster 2026](https://www.boosterconf.no/2026/program/wednesday/9_short_talks_and_workshops/dreggen_4/fun-with-f-and-turtle-geometry/)

## 🚀 Getting started

Make sure you have .NET 10 SDK installed by running `dotnet --version` in the terminal. The .NET 10 SDK can be downloaded from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download. 

1. Clone the repository
1. Run `dotnet restore` from the project root the first time
1. Run `dotnet watch run`. This will run the app and automatically rebuild the app when you make changes in the code
1. Navigate to <http://localhost:5000> in your browser
1. If you see a square you are good to go! 

### Alternative ways of running the code

#### Running devcontainer in codespaces

This allows you to work in the browser using GitHub Codespaces

#### Running devcontainer locally

This is using docker locally to create a dev environment. Something in between the other two options, convenient if docker is set up properly, fiddly if not.
