# 🐢 Fun with F# and turtle geometry

Getting ready for [Booster 2026](https://www.boosterconf.no/2026/program/wednesday/9_short_talks_and_workshops/dreggen_4/fun-with-f-and-turtle-geometry/)

## Prerequisits

## 🚀 Getting started

### Running natively with dotnet

This is the most convenient way to work, but it will require installing .NET 10 SDK.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `dotnet restore` from the project root the first time
3. Run `dotnet watch run` to rebuild the app when you make changes in the code
4. Navigate to <http://localhost:5000> in your browser

### Running devcontainer in codespaces

This allows you to work in the browser using GitHub Codespaces

### Running devcontainer locally

This is using docker locally to create a dev environment. Something in between the other two options, convenient if
docker is set up properly, fiddly if not.
